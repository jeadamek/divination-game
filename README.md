## ✏️ About

This project was developed on Stage 5 in the Explorer course at the [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course assignments click [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat). 

In this project, the main goal was to understand and practice JavaScript. For that, a divination game was built. In this application, the user must guess the random number generated. When the number is right, the game shows the number of times the user tried to guess. 

I could practice and study:

- Flex and Grid Display;
- DOM Manipulation;
- Callback functions;
- JavaScript Events.

The game can be seen in the image below:<br/>
